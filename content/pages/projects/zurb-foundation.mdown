## Foundation is awesome.

I come out of the gate saying, "Foundation is awesome." It's the perfect flexible grid from desktop to mobile.

Foundation includes forms, buttons, and a UI library. Plus other [ZURB Playground](http://www.zurb.com/playground) favorites like [Orbit](http://www.zurb.com/playground/orbit-jquery-image-slider) and [Reveal](http://www.zurb.com/playground/reveal-modal-plugin).

With [case studies](http://foundation.zurb.com/case-foundation.php) like [ZURB Jobs](http://www.zurb.com/jobs), [Swizzle](http://foundation.zurb.com/case-swizzle.php) and [the Foundation site itself](http://foundation.zurb.com/case-foundation.php), how can we deny ZURB of hitting this one out of the park?
