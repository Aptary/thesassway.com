Sassy Modular Scale is a Sass based mixin that calculates the incremental values of the modular scale in proportion to a set size and ratio. It was inspired by and adapted from Tim Brown's modularscale.com.

Sassy Modular Scale can be used as a Compass extension and can be installed as a [Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/modular-scale) or copied into your project as a simple mixin. Either way, it works just the same.
