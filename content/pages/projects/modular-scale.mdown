## What is Modular Scale?

Modular Scale is a fresh new Sass project inspired by [Tim Brown's](http://twitter.com/nicewebtype) [modularscale.com](http://modularscale.com/) that does all the heavy lifting and math for you to calculate the values of a modular scale. It can be used as a Compass extension, installed as a [Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/modular-scale), or as vanilla Sass mixin.

### No calculator? I don't believe it.

I'm serious. There's no calculator needed. The math is all done for you (Sass knows math).

Tim also wrote a favorite'd article at [A List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com/) titled ["More Meaningful Typography"](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/more-meaningful-typography/) and gave a talk at [Build](http://www.buildconference.com/) titled ["More Perfect Typography"](http://vimeo.com/17079380) which has spawned a slue of new thoughts around the use real fonts on the web and creating a modular scale for web design.

Additional inspiration goes to [Robert Bringhurst](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bringhurst), author of ["The Elements of Typographic Style"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Typographic_Style) - specifically Chapter 8 titled "Shaping the Page"

that got started from inspiration [with an answer to a Tweet](http://twitter.theinfo.org/100305459914874880).mixin that does all the math for you to calculate the values of the modular scale. So put down the calculator and let Sass do the work! It was inspired by and adapted from Tim Brown's modularscale.com.

Sassy Modular Scale can be used as a Compass extension and can be installed as a [Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/modular-scale) or copied into your project as a simple mixin. Either way, it works just the same.
