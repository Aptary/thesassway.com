  In a future article, we'll be talking about the various [Sass Number Functions](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/Sass/Script/Functions.html#number_functions) you can use to manipulate numbers.
  
  ### From the docs on [Sass Number Functions](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/Sass/Script/Functions.html#number_functions)

  * `percentage($value)` - Converts a unitless number to a percentage
  * `round($value)` - Rounds a number to the nearest whole number.
  * `ceil($value)` - Rounds a number up to the nearest whole number.
  * `floor($value)` - Rounds a number down to the nearest whole number.
  * `abs($value)` - Returns the absolute value of a number.
