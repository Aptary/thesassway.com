Summary: When you begin working with Sass you'll notice that there are two concepts with the same name. One being the name of the project and the other one being the name of one of the two syntax styles. So lets get going with the disambiguation!


# Disambiguation: Sass, sass and scss?

When you begin working with Sass you'll notice that there are two concepts with the same name. One being the name of the project and the other one being the name of one of the two syntax styles.

To some it may be pretty obvious how to differentiate them; however, you'll see new users using expressions like these:

> I'm using SCSS and it's awesome!
> What version of SASS do you use?
> Sass Syntax all the way!

Yes, they all make sense (kind of):

- SCSS: Sassy CSS?
- SASS: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets
- Sass Syntax: Just no.

But... **YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG** (pun intended). Mainly because that's not the official way to refer to the project and it begins to become confusing if there's no centralized concept for all of us to use.

So lets get going with the disambiguation:

## Sass

Sass is used to refer the **project**, which englobes the two syntax styles, hence Sass includes sass.

You'll usually, for instance: 

> Did you install **Sass**?
> I love **Sass**! I use it on every project!

Note that when you're referring to the project the first letter is capitalized, denoting a proper name.

## sass

Name of the original syntax style that was provided with Sass. One of its characteristics is the significant whitespace and the lack of punctuation.

Example:

> **sass** allows you to use + instead of scss @include
> When I began working with Sass I fell in love with **sass**.

## scss

Name of the second syntax style which was implemented on Sass as a "Gateway Drug" for new developers. The main characteristic is that it's a superset of CSS, which means that it's valid CSS!

Example:

> Did you check the scss file?
> scss is the gateway drug to get into Sass.

### All together!

> When I began using Sass I used scss, after a couple of projects I began working with sass and fell in love with the lack of punctuation noise!
