# Referencing Parent Selectors using the ampersand (&)

This is the first in a series of posts in the works I'm calling "The Sass Way" ([#TheSassWay](http://adamstacoviak.com/posts/tag/thesassway/)). There are clear ways to do things using vanilla [CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/), but there are significantly different ways for writing CSS stylesheets using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). With any luck, these posts will get broken out into its own blog, when, and if ever, I get around to doing that.

Until then ...

## Let's get started

If you've been using Sass for any length of time, then you're likely to be familiar with being able to reference parent selectors using the `&` character. A simple example might be something like this:

Sass:

    :::sass
    h3
      font-size: 20px
      margin-bottom: 10px
      &.some-selector
        font-size: 24px
        margin-bottom: 20px

CSS (output):

    :::css
    h3 {
      font-size: 20px;
      margin-bottom: 10px;
    }
    h3.some-selector {
      font-size: 24px;
      margin-bottom: 20px;
    }

Pretty neat huh, how we didn't have to write out the h3 again. With Sass all we have to do is nest the next ruleset and attach the `&` in place of the repeating selector and we're golden.

## Wait. There's more.

This is something I stumbled onto today while working with some Sass written by my bud [Wynn Netherland](http://wynnnetherland.com/). Though, I don't see this mentioned in [the Sass documentation](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#referencing_parent_selectors_). You do [read documentation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM) don't you?

So, what if I wanted to style all my `h3` headings a certain way, but for this one `h3`, that is also a child of a certain selector, I want to style it slightly different than the others? Well, with CSS we know how that goes, we'd have to write it all out. Verbose. Bah ...

But with Sass ... what options do we have? Check this out ...

Sass:

    :::sass
    h3
      font-size: 20px
      margin-bottom: 10px
      .some-parent-selector &
        font-size: 24px
        margin-bottom: 20px

CSS (output):

    :::css
    h3 {
      font-size: 20px;
      margin-bottom: 10px;
    }
    .some-parent-selector h3 {
      font-size: 24px;
      margin-bottom: 20px;
    }

Based on this code, you can place an `&` at the end of your selector declaration in place of the repeating selector, and sit back and enjoy the awesomeness of Sass.

My example, is very simplistic but [Joel Oliveira](https://twitter.com/jayroh) goes deeper on the subject with his post "[The ampersand &amp; a killer Sass feature](http://joeloliveira.com/2011/06/28/the-ampersand-a-killer-sass-feature/)". I highly recommend it.

In the coming weeks I'll be covering more topics on writing CSS "The Sass Way". [Follow me](http://twitter.com/adamstac) as well as [The Sass Way](http://twitter.com/thesassway) on Twitter for updates.
