# Here's your chance to become a contributor to The Sass Way!

<a href="http://github.com/thesassway/thesassway.com"><img src="/images/articles/octocat.png" class="ml1 mb1" alt="" align="right"></a>

It's no secret that things have been a little quiet around here lately. Part of that is that is that we've been working on some much needed infrastructure updates. We recently moved the site over from [Nesta](http://nestacms.com) to [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) and just rolled out a new design for the site that is consistent with the updated brand for Sass and looks great on mobile.

Today, I'd like to announce that we've put the [source code](http://github.com/thesassway/thesassway.com) for TheSassWay.com on GitHub and we'd like to invite you to contribute! You heard me correctly! If you've been looking for a way to give back to the Sass community we'd love to have your help around here.

Our vision for The Sass Way is to be the premiere source of articles, tutorials, and news about Sass. We want to make it easy for folks to get up and running with the language we have come to know and love. Sass has changed our lives for the better and we want to tell the world about it.

But we can't do this without you! We need your help! Starting today we are accepting new article and news submissions from anyone in the Sass community via GitHub.
